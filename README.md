This repository has a simple java application that will validate the email address as per the below instructions.

Email address should be as name@domain.tld where "name" can contain the characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _ , and . (dot).

And "domain" can contain the characters a-z, and -. "name" and "domain" must be non-empty. "tld" can be "com", "org", or "net".

We have unit test cases for validating the application using the JUnit test suite.
